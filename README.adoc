It has almost no error checking and is otherwise unsuitable for "real work" and it never will.

I started with this tutorial: https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/[Write a Shell in C].

The comments explain it pretty well.
But check out my article, http://ratfactor.com/zig/forking-is-cool[Forking is Cool] for the whole story.

Enjoy! :-)
